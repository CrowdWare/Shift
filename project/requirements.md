# Requirements

- Decentralized DHT (no servers thats collects private information or which can be stutted down)
- Pictures and videos should be stored anonymous on other servers from other platforms

## Phase One
We only need a web server with a small database to hold like 10.000.000 records.
 In phase Four we are going to cut the database out to stay decentral.
 So we only need the database, maybe AWS, for just one year.
